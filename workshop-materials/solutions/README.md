## Usage Instructions

### For Individual Labs
1. Navigate to the specific lab solution directory
2. Copy the terraform files to your lab working directory
3. Update `terraform.tfvars` with your project details
4. Run the deployment script: `./scripts/deploy.sh`
5. Validate with: `./scripts/validate.sh`

### For Complete Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all labs in sequence
cd workshop-materials/solutions/
export PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export TF_STATE_BUCKET=your-bucket
./deploy-all-labs.sh
```

### Individual Lab Quick Start
```bash
cd lab-01-gcp-organizational-foundation/
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your project details
./scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/validate.sh
```
