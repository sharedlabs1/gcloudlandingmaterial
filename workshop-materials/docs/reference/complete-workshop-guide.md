## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Terraform Issues

#### State Lock Issues
```bash
# View current locks
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID

# Prevent locks with proper CI/CD
# Use terraform plan in pull requests
# Use terraform apply in protected branches
```

#### Module Path Issues
```bash
# Local modules
source = "../modules/vpc-network"

# Remote modules  
source = "git::https://github.com/org/modules.git//vpc?ref=v1.0"

# Registry modules
source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
version = "~> 7.0"
```

#### Resource Dependencies
```hcl
# Explicit dependencies
resource "google_compute_instance" "app" {
  depends_on = [
    google_compute_subnetwork.app_subnet,
    google_service_account.app_sa
  ]
}

# Implicit dependencies (preferred)
network_interface {
  subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.app_subnet.self_link
}
```

### Common GCP Issues

#### API Enablement
```bash
# Check enabled APIs
gcloud services list --enabled

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com

# Batch enable APIs
apis=("compute.googleapis.com" "iam.googleapis.com")
for api in "${apis[@]}"; do
  gcloud services enable $api
done
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Check current permissions
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID

# Test service account permissions
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json
gcloud auth list
```

#### Quota Limits
```bash
# Check quotas
gcloud compute project-info describe --format="table(quotas.metric,quotas.limit,quotas.usage)"

# Request quota increases
# Use GCP Console → IAM & Admin → Quotas
```

### Network Troubleshooting

#### Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Test private Google access
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE --command="curl -H 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/hostname"

# Check firewall rules
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="direction:INGRESS"

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup HOSTNAME
dig HOSTNAME
```

#### Load Balancer Issues
```bash
# Check backend health
gcloud compute backend-services get-health BACKEND_SERVICE --global

# Check SSL certificates
gcloud compute ssl-certificates list

# Test connectivity
curl -I https://LOAD_BALANCER_IP
```
