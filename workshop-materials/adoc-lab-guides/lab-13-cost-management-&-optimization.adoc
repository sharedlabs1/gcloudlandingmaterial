As part of TechCorp's cloud transformation initiative, this lab focuses on building enterprise-grade infrastructure that meets fintech compliance requirements while enabling rapid development and deployment capabilities.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

• Configure cost monitoring and budgeting with alerting
• Implement resource optimization and right-sizing
• Set up automated cost control and governance
• Configure cost allocation and chargeback mechanisms
• Implement cost optimization recommendations and automation

== Concept Overview (Theory: 15-20 minutes)

=== Key Concepts

_Cloud Financial Management_: Cost allocation, budgeting, and financial governance.

_Resource Optimization_: Right-sizing, scheduling, and automated resource management.

_Cost Monitoring_: Real-time cost tracking, anomaly detection, and alerting.

_Optimization Strategies_: Reserved instances, committed use discounts, and preemptible instances.
