= Lab 05: Identity and Access Management

== Lab Overview

_Duration_: 60 minutes 
_Difficulty_: Intermediate  
_Prerequisites_: Successful completion of previous labs

=== Lab Description
Implement comprehensive IAM strategy with custom roles, service accounts, workload identity, and access controls following principle of least privilege for TechCorp's security requirements.

=== Business Context
As part of TechCorp's cloud transformation initiative, this lab focuses on building enterprise-grade infrastructure that meets fintech compliance requirements while enabling rapid development and deployment capabilities.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

• Design and implement custom IAM roles for different job functions
• Configure service accounts with minimal required permissions
• Set up Workload Identity for secure service-to-service authentication
• Implement conditional access policies and constraints
• Configure comprehensive audit logging for compliance

== Concept Overview (Theory: 15-20 minutes)

=== Key Concepts

_IAM Best Practices_: Principle of least privilege, role-based access control, and separation of duties.

_Service Account Management_: Workload Identity, service account keys, and secure authentication patterns.

_Custom Roles_: Creating fine-grained permissions for specific job functions and compliance requirements.

_Access Controls_: Conditional access, organization policies, and audit logging for financial services compliance.
