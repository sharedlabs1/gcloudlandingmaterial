=== Lab Description
Set up comprehensive monitoring infrastructure with custom metrics, dashboards, SLIs/SLOs, and alerting policies to ensure TechCorp's application reliability and performance.

=== Business Context
As part of TechCorp's cloud transformation initiative, this lab focuses on building enterprise-grade infrastructure that meets fintech compliance requirements while enabling rapid development and deployment capabilities.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

• Configure comprehensive monitoring for infrastructure and applications
• Create custom dashboards for different stakeholder views
• Implement SLI/SLO monitoring and error budgets
• Set up intelligent alerting with proper escalation
• Configure monitoring for compliance and audit requirements

== Concept Overview (Theory: 15-20 minutes)

=== Key Concepts

_Observability Strategy_: Metrics, logs, traces, and the three pillars of observability.

_SLI/SLO Framework_: Service Level Indicators and Objectives for measuring and improving reliability.

_Custom Metrics_: Application-specific monitoring and business metrics collection.

_Alerting Strategies_: Smart alerting, escalation policies, and on-call management.
