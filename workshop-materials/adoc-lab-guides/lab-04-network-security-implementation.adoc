=== Lab Description
Configure advanced network security including Cloud Armor, DDoS protection, WAF policies, and intrusion detection systems to protect TechCorp's financial applications.

=== Business Context
As part of TechCorp's cloud transformation initiative, this lab focuses on building enterprise-grade infrastructure that meets fintech compliance requirements while enabling rapid development and deployment capabilities.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

• Configure Cloud Armor WAF policies for application protection
• Implement DDoS protection and rate limiting
• Set up intrusion detection and monitoring
• Configure geo-blocking and IP allowlisting
• Implement compliance-grade network security controls

== Concept Overview (Theory: 15-20 minutes)

=== Key Concepts

_Cloud Armor Protection_: Web Application Firewall capabilities, DDoS mitigation, and bot protection.

_Security Policies_: Rate limiting, geo-blocking, and custom security rules for financial services.

_Intrusion Detection_: Network-based monitoring and alerting for security threats.

_Compliance Requirements_: Implementing PCI DSS, SOX, and other fintech security standards.
